  title: "Seminar in Mathematical Business Analysis"
  subtitle: "The main purpose of this seminar is to develop the capability to apply quantitative knowledge to real and ill-defined problems. It tries to bridge the gap between the theory of quantitative decision approaches such as management science/operations research, information systems, and statistics (now mainly collected in the Business Analytics field), and the application of these approaches to the solution of actual business problems"
